# The Code Behind *Arrival* (The Movie) Companion

## Synopsis

These notebooks correspond to Christopher Wolfram's recent LiveEdu.tv coding session in which he analyzed the logograms and other content from the 2016 film *Arrival*. The session can be found by using the following link:

[The Code Behind Arrival The Movie](https://www.liveedu.tv/christopherwolfram/videos/LAAJL-the-code-behind-arrival-the-movie/)

The content found here is meant to be a companion to this coding session, allowing anyone to modify and tinker with some of the content from the movie. .nb files can be opened and modified in either Mathematica, the Wolfram Cloud or the Wolfram Development Platform.

Please Note: Some of the features used by Christopher in the coding session utilize features from version 11.1 of the Wolfram Language.
